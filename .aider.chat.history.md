#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to describe the logo image you want to generate.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need the `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file to create the logo description. Please add that file to the chat. Once it’s added, I’ll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for updating `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and creating the logo file.

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can create the appropriate *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for updating the title and description.

A vibrant, playful logo featuring a stylized compass rose with bright, gradient colors (orange, teal, and purple). The compass points are slightly rounded and have a subtle 3D effect. In the center of the compass, a small, whimsical rocket icon is placed, symbolizing adventure and exploration. The background is a soft, light blue gradient that fades from top to bottom, giving the logo a fresh, energetic feel. The overall composition is balanced and eye‑catching, suitable for a mobile app icon that conveys excitement and daily discovery.
